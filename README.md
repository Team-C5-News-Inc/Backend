## General Description

News inc is an online newspaper that publishes news on a large scale every day (50-100 publications daily). This news is drawn from the world's leading newspapers and references each source accurately. It has 5 to 10 categories and each news has tags that identify it. It also has its own commenting system, so it has users with different roles (visitors, administrators, etc.).
